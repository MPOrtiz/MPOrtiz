🙋‍♀️ About Me
Hi there! I’m Martha Patricia Ortiz, a Data Scientist with over 6 years of experience in data analysis, process optimization, and strategic decision-making powered by data-driven insights 📊.

🎓 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering and recently graduated from a Data Science bootcamp, where I applied machine learning models to real-world business challenges.

🛠️ My skill set includes:

-Programming with Python and SQL

-Data analysis and visualization using Power BI, Excel, and Tableau

-Modeling with Scikit-learn, pandas, and statsmodels

-Techniques such as EDA, A/B testing, Feature Engineering, and more

🌍 I thrive in cross-functional teams, love translating technical results for non-technical audiences, and always seek opportunities to drive meaningful impact and continuous improvement.
